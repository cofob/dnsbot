# Guide to making a contribution

## Workspace setup

We recommend using our [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Of course, you can also use your favorite IDE.

Requirements:
 - Rust
 - Cargo
 - Git
 - [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) support in IDE

## Sending issues & patches

You can send your issues `@cofob:matrix.org` or `cofob at riseup.net` via email.

## Thanks for your interest in the project!
